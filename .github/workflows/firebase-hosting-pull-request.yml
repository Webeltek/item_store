#The absence of channelId means the Firebase action deploys 
#to a temporary preview channel instead of the live channel.
#The Firebase CLI, when used without channelId: live, 
#creates a unique preview URL you can share for that PR.
#This only happens for PRs from the same repo, not forks 
#(due to this line in the workflow):
